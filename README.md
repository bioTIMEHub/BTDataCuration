## Requirements

Following along with the workshop documents will require:
- R (preferably 3.8 +)
- RStudio
- R packages `tidyverse, readxl,` and `maps`

**Optional**:
- locally installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version control software)

## How to use

This workshop tutorial is written primarily in R and Markdown. Open up either the `.Rmd` or rendered `.html` file to follow along the descriptions, instructions, and break-downs to data wrangling, cleaning, and preparing dataset files. Some code chunks will be put in for the purpose of showing you what we might do in hypothetical situations, but not to be run/evaluated.

Before beginning, make sure the required software packages listed above are installed.
